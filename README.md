**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS is employed to control the visual presentation of web pages. It defines the styling, layout, and design aspects, including fonts, colors, spacing, and responsive layouts.<br>
**JavaScript:** JavaScript is utilized to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the frontend. It enables features like form validation, real-time notifications, and responsive behaviors, enhancing the overall user experience.<br>
